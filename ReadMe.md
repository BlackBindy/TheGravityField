The Gravity Field
- Computer Graphics (1st semester, 2016) Term Project

 'The Gravity Field' is an Arcade/Adventure game revolving around puzzles and a direction-fixed 3D platformer game in which the player controls the main figure by pressing the virtual buttons on the screen like Super Mario Bros. This game is made using a game engine from Unity and compatible with Android.

 The main figure of this game has a special ability to generate 'Gravity Field' around itself which is used to manipulate the gravity in its space. The gravity field is composed of 3 states composed of 'Normal', 'Weakened Gravity' and 'Strengthened ravity'.
 The normal state denotes that the normal gravity works in the gravity field so all the objects in it would work as usual. In the weakened and strengthened gravity states, respective strength of the gravity differs from the normal state.
 For example, given falling objects, the objects in the gravity field would fall slower in the weakened gravity state than usual, while these would fall faster in the strengthened gravity state.
 
 The goal of this game is simple. Player should move the main figure from the start point to the goal overcoming several obstacles by using its special ability. There may be various stages and difficulties to go through with.
