The Gravity Field
- Computer Graphics (1st semester, 2016) Term Project

 'The Gravity Field' is an Android game where the player should solve the puzzle using the gravity field.
 It is a direction-fixed 3D platformer game in which the player control the ball by pressing the virtual buttons on the screen.
 There is a special ability named as 'Gravity Field' which is used to manipulate the gravity around the ball.
 The gravity field is composed of 3 states, 'Normal', 'Weakened Gravity', 'Strengthened Gravity'.
 In 'Weakend Gravity' state all the objects around the ball would fall down slower than usual, while it falls faster than usual in 'Strengthened Gravity' state.
 The player should move the ball from the start point to the goal by solving the puzzle using this special ability.
